
b1 = 0, as n is smallish
b2 = 1, as the graph is relatively dense
b3 = 0, as the graph does not contain any self loops
b4 = 0, as the graph is not a multigraph
b5 = 0, as the graph has no negative cycles
b6 = 0, as all nodes are reachable from the start node
binary = 010000 
base10 = 16

- This is a very generic graph, with some negative weight edges
- Every node is reachable and there are no cycles
