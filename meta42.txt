- This is a large, sparse graph with two negative cycles and three self-loops
- The graph contains 1000 nodes (n = 1000) and 1011 edges (m = 1011)
- There are 9 queries (q = 9) and the start node is 42 (s = 42)
- The two negative cycles are along nodes:
  3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 19 -> 3
  29 -> 41 -> 46 -> 27 -> 45 -> 29
- The three self-loops are at nodes 417, 614, and 714
- Not a multigraph
- All nodes are reachable from the start node
- Edge weights were randomly generated in the range -2000 to 2000.
- This file is useful to test whether a program will find negative cycles in a large graph
